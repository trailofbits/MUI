With the Manticore User Interface (MUI) project, we provide a graphical user interface plugin for various disassemblers to allow users to easily interact with and view progress of the `Manticore symbolic execution engine <https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore>`_ for analysis of smart contracts and native binaries. 

We are currently developing MUI plugins for `Binary Ninja <https://binary.ninja/>`_ and  `Ghidra <https://ghidra-sre.org/>`_. Information on how to install and use each plugin is documented in each plugin's respective directory.

❗ATTENTION❗ This project is under active development and may be unstable or unusable. Please open an issue if you have any difficulties using the existing features. New feature development will be considered on a case by case basis.
