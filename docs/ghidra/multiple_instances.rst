Multiple Instances
==================

ManticoreUI supports the concurrent execution of multiple Manticore instances.
You can do so by simply re-populating the Setup dialog and clicking the `Run` button again.

You can inspect a specific Manticore instance through interactions with the following widgets.

Log Widget
----------

Each Manticore instance will have its own Tab component in the Log Widget header.

Clicking the Tab of a Manticore instance will change the currently-displayed Manticore instance to the instance associated with the tab.

State List
----------

The State List will display the states of the Manticore instance selected in the Log Widget.
