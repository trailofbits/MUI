With the Manticore User Interface (MUI) project, we provide a graphical user interface plugin for Binary Ninja to allow users to easily interact with and view progress of the [Manticore symbolic execution engine](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) for analysis of smart contracts and native binaries.

❗ATTENTION❗ This project is under active development and may be unstable or unusable. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/trailofbits/ManticoreUI/issues) if you have any difficulties using the existing features. New feature development will be considered on a case by case basis.
